## Work in Progress Disclaimer

**This project is currently still at early alpha status.** I feel like I should point this out a little stronger because I just saw that in the last two weeks alone this repository was cloned over 170 times. There are still elemental things missing and there have to be made and will be made lots of additions and changes in structure and wording.

I choose this topic because it is important and complex. Personally I wanted to take the challenge to build something useful by using some spare time every day. (By the time I am writing these words my daily commits go back to 18.02.2022 so I already succeeded at least for the first four weeks).

**Btw:** If you have any comments, suggestions or corrections I am happy to receive them via email at "howtovalidatenames AT dethlefs DOT eu"
