## About
In 2022 nobody should have to be confronted with problems while filling out an online form. Still we all know a lot of cases in which valid legal names are either not accepted, not transmitted or not printed out correctly. 

I am totally convinced that in not one of those cases the reason is malicious intent but rather the challenge for software developers to implement validation rules for names from other languages and cultures than their own.

So my idea is to setup a systematic collection of international examples and even validation rules (e.g. as Regex) which are free for everyone to use. I hope this can help to promote respectful validation standards in IT products.

## Ideas to explore further in the upcoming time
- Research list of international language standards
- Collection of examples where validation did not work
- Example validation rules (e.g. as Regex)
- Research and list of languages (at the beginning perhaps with focus on European Union to narrow this down)
